# g3-agents — Multi-Agent Orchestration for OpenCode and Claude Code

A set of agent configs (agents) for OpenCode with mediation, recursive task decomposition, and zero-tolerance review. No dependency installation required. A Claude Code port of the same system ships in `.claude/agents/`.

## 📋 Purpose

The system implements mediated multi-agent orchestration: four roles interact through a strict contract via an orchestrator (`@flow`), which decides on task decomposition, delegation, and reviewer verdicts. Agents **never communicate directly** — all inter-agent communication goes through `@flow`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project requires no dependency installation — once the `.opencode/agents/` directory is in place, OpenCode automatically discovers agents via YAML front-matter in compatible runtimes (e.g. Claude Code, OpenCode Skills).

Send tasks to `@flow` — the orchestrator handles decomposition and coordination. A realistic flow with revision cycles:

```text
@flow → decomposition → @player (first version) → @coach → REVISE
→ @player (revised code) → @coach → ACCEPT
→ @flow collects results, requests merged review → done
```

## 📥 Installation

Use `scripts/install.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `scripts/install.ps1` (Windows). Interface:

```text
scripts/install.sh <opencode|claude|all> [--global|--local]   # default: --global
```

| Tool | global | local |
| --- | --- | --- |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/agents/` | `./.opencode/agents/` |
| claude | `~/.claude/agents/` | `./.claude/agents/` |

From a clone of this repository:

```bash
scripts/install.sh opencode   # OpenCode, global
scripts/install.sh claude     # Claude Code, global
```

Without keeping a clone (temporary directory):

```bash
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d) && \
git clone https://github.com/BlackLik/g3-agents.git "$tmpdir" && \
"$tmpdir/scripts/install.sh" all && \
rm -rf "$tmpdir"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
scripts/install.ps1 opencode
scripts/install.ps1 claude
```

> **Note:** Installation only copies/overwrites files from the repository —
> your existing agents are never deleted.

In this repository the Claude Code port (`.claude/agents/`: flow, player,
coach — no subflow, `flow` recurses into itself) is discovered automatically.
Start with `claude --agent flow` to run the orchestrator as the main session.

## 🗑 Uninstall

Same interface, removes only this project's files by explicit list:

```bash
scripts/uninstall.sh opencode   # OpenCode, global
scripts/uninstall.sh claude     # Claude Code, global
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
scripts/uninstall.ps1 opencode
scripts/uninstall.ps1 claude
```

## 🏗 Architecture

```text
User → @flow (orchestrator) → @player (executor) → @coach (reviewer)
         ↑                                                        │
         └──── @flow evaluates coach verdict: ACCEPT→done          ↓
                  REVISE/REJECT → instruction to player────────────┘
```

`@coach` **never sends** revisions directly to `@player`. All verdicts go through `@flow`, which decides whether to continue the cycle or terminate.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The orchestrator decomposes tasks by complexity and caps recursion at depth 2. After all subtasks complete, a final merged review is requested from `@coach`.

## 📐 Depth System

A depth system controls recursion:

| Depth | Description | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | Top-level task | Decomposition per rules below |
| **1** | First recursion | Standard decomposition |
| **2** | Second recursion (terminal) | Forced delegation directly to `@player` — no further splitting |

## 📏 Task Decomposition Rules

| Complexity | Depth < 2 | Depth == 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple** (≤2 concerns) | Delegate directly to `@player` | Delegate to `@player` |
| **Complex** (>2 concerns) | Split into subtasks, delegate each via `@flow` with depth+1 (`@subflow` — same thing, but runs as a subagent) | Force-delegate to `@player` |

## 🎯 Roles: Details

### `@flow` — Orchestrator (primary, temperature 0.1)

- The only top-level interface with the user
- Receives requests, decomposes tasks per depth/concerns rules
- Delegates work exclusively via the `task()` tool
- Evaluates `@coach` verdicts and decides: continue the cycle or move to the next task
- Never answers the user directly — only through the mediation loop

### `@player` — Executor (subagent, temperature 0.6)

- Minimalist executor: minimal code, no explanations
- Does not refactor others' code, does not add validation by default
- Works strictly within the scope of the assigned task
- On linter/test errors — returns the error upward, does not fix

### `@coach` — Reviewer (subagent, temperature 0.2)

- Zero-tolerance checks: security, correctness, anti-patterns, performance
- Checks for AI-generated patterns and security issues
- Returns ACCEPT / REVISE / REJECT with specific feedback
- Does not make code changes — review only

### `@subflow` — Recursive Orchestrator (subagent, temperature 0.1)

- Identical to `@flow`, but runs as a subagent
- Used for complex tasks with >2 concerns at depth < 2
- Each recursion level increases depth by +1

## 📊 Example Task Flow

```text
User: "@flow: implement a REST API for user CRUD"
       │
       ▼
@flow (depth=0, complex → split)
       ├── Task 1: "create User model and validation schema" → @flow(depth=1)
       │                    │
       │                    ▼
       │              @player → code → @coach → ACCEPT
       │
       └── Task 2: "create endpoints GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /users" → @flow(depth=1)
                            │
                            ▼
                      @player → code → @coach → REVISE (security issue)
                            │
                            ▼
                      @player (with revision instructions) → revised code → @coach → ACCEPT

@flow collects results from all subtasks and requests a final merged review from @coach
```

## ⚠️ Important Rules

- **`@flow` never answers directly** — only through the mediation loop
- **`@player` does not explain itself** — code speaks for itself
- **`@coach` is uncompromising** — security and correctness over speed
- **Depth 2 is terminal** — at depth 2, tasks are not split further but delegated directly to `@player`
